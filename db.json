        "description": "A young dwarf prince set out to forge a weapon that would be regarded as a symbol of unity among his people. Venturing deep under the mountains, deeper than any dwarf had ever delved, the prince came to the blazing heart of a great volcano. With the aid of Moradin, a god of creation, he first crafted four mighty tools: the Starmetal Pick, the Earthheart Forge, the Anvil of Songs, and the Shaping Hammer. With these tools, he forged the Axe of the Dwarvish Lords.\n\nArmed with the Artifact, the prince brought peace to the dwarf clans, ending grudges and answering slights. The clans became allies, and they threw back their enemies and enjoyed an era of prosperity. This young dwarf is remembered as the First King. When he became old, he passed the weapon, which had become his badge of office, to his heir. The rightful inheritors passed the axe on for many generations.\n\nLater, in an era marked by treachery and wickedness, the axe was lost in a bloody civil war fomented by greed for its power and the status it bestowed. Centuries later, the dwarves still search for the axe, and many adventurers have made careers of chasing after rumors and plundering old vaults to find it.\n\nMagic Weapon: The Axe of the Dwarvish Lords is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it.\n\nWhen you attack a creature with the axe and roll a 20 on the d20 for the attack roll, the axe deals an extra 20 Slashing damage.\n\nThe axe has T with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged attack using this weapon, it deals an extra 1d8 Force damage, or an extra 2d8 Force damage if the target is a creature of the Giant type. Immediately after hitting or missing, the weapon flies back to your hand.\n\nBlessings of Moradin: While attuned to the axe, you gain the following benefits:\n\nDarkvision: You gain Darkvision with a range of 60 feet. If you already have Darkvision, its range increases by 60 feet.\n\nFortitude of Stone: Your Constitution increases by 2, to a maximum of 20.\n\nGifts of the Creator: You have proficiency with Brewer's Supplies, Mason's Tools, and Smith's Tools.\n\nOne with the Forge: You have Immunity to Poison damage and Resistance to Fire damage.\n\nSunder: When you hit an object with the axe, the object takes the maximum amount of damage possible.\n\nConjure Earth Elemental: While holding the axe, you can take a Magic action to summon an Earth Elemental. It appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 30 feet of yourself, understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your Initiative count. The elemental disappears after 24 hours, when it dies, or when you dismiss it as a Bonus Action. You can't use this property again until the next dawn.\n\nRandom Properties: The axe has the following random properties:\n\n2 Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties properties\n\n1 Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties property\n\n2 Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties properties\n\nTravel the Depths: You can take a Magic action to touch the axe to a fixed piece of dwarven stonework and cast Teleport from the axe. If your intended destination is underground, there is no chance of a mishap or arriving somewhere unexpected. You can't use this property again until 3 days have passed.\n\nDestroying the Axe: The only way to destroy the axe is to melt it down in the Earthheart Forge, where it was created. It must remain in the burning forge for 50 years before it finally succumbs to the fire and is consumed.",

        "description": "The creations of the immortal hag Baba Yaga defy the laws of mortal magic. Among the notorious implements that cement her legend on countless worlds are the artifacts that propel her through the planes: Baba Yaga's Mortar and Pestle. These signature tools of Baba Yaga are a single artifact for purposes of attunement. Should the two objects become separated, the pestle appears next to the mortar at the next dawn.\n\nRandom Properties: This artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the \"Artifacts\" section of the Dungeon Master's Guide:\n\n2 Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties properties\n\n1 Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties property\n\n1 Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties property\n\nProperties of the Mortar: The mortar is a Tiny wooden bowl. However, the mortar increases in size to accommodate anything you place inside, expanding-if there's enough space-up to Large size, meaning it can hold even a Large creature.\n\nProperties of the Pestle: The pestle is a 6-inch-long, worn wooden tool. Once during your turn while you are holding the pestle, you can extend it into a quarterstaff or shrink it back into a pestle (no action required). As a quarterstaff, the pestle is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.\n\nThe pestle has 12 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using the pestle, you can expend up to 3 of its charges to deal an extra 1d8 force damage for each charge expended. The pestle regains all expended charges daily at dawn.\n\nPerfect Tools: While holding the mortar and pestle, you can use your action to say the name of any nonmagical plant, mineral, or fluid and an amount of the material worth 10 gp or less. The mortar instantly fills with the desired amount of that material. Once you use this action, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\nYou can also use the artifact as alchemist's supplies, brewer's supplies, cook's utensils, an herbalism kit, and a poisoner's kit. You have advantage on any check you make using the artifact as one of these tools.\n\nPrimal Parts: As an action while the pestle and the mortar is within 5 feet of you, you can command the pestle to grind. For the next minute, or until you use your action to verbally command it to stop, the pestle moves on its own, grinding the contents of the mortar into a mush or fine powder that's equally useful for cooking or alchemy. At the start of each of your turns, whatever is in the mortar takes 4d10 force damage. If this reduces the target's hit points to 0, the target is reduced to powder, pulp, or paste, as appropriate. Only magic items are unaffected. If you wish, when the pestle stops, you can have the mortar separate its contents-like powdered bone, crushed herbs, pulped organs-into separate piles.\n\nTraverse the Night: If you are holding the pestle while you are inside the mortar, you can use your action to verbally command the mortar to travel to a specific place or creature.\n\nYou don't need to know where your destination is, but it must be a specific destination-not just the nearest river or a red dragon's lair. If the stated destination is within 1,000 miles of you, the mortar lifts into the air and vanishes. You and any creatures in the mortar travel through a dreamlike sky, with hazy reflections of the world passing by below. Creatures might see images of you streaking through the sky between your point of origin and the destination. You arrive at the location 1 hour later or, if it is night, 1 minute later.\n\nBones Know Their Home: When you command the mortar to travel, you can instead throw out the dust or paste of something ground by the mortar and name a location on a different plane of existence or a different world on the Material Plane. If that material came from a creature native to the named plane or world, the mortar travels through an empty night sky to an unoccupied space at that destination, arriving in 1 minute.\n\nDestroying the Mortar and Pestle: The mortar and pestle are destroyed if they are crushed underfoot by the Dancing Hut of Baba Yaga or by Baba Yaga herself.",

Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed in the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, there is a 50 percent chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A creature inside the bag can use its action to try to escape with a successful DC 15 Strength check. Another creature can use its action to reach into the bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength check (provided it isn't pulled inside the bag first). Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag is devoured, its body destroyed.\n\nInanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold a cubic foot of such material. However, once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and spits them out into another plane of existence. The GM determines the time and plane.\n\nIf the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and anything contained within it is transported to a random location on the Astral Plane.",

A creature whose soul has been devoured by Blackrazor can be restored to life only by a Wish spell.\n\nWhen Blackrazor devours a soul that isn't yours, you gain Temporary Hit Points equal to the slain creature's Hit Points maximum.\n\nHaste: Blackrazor can cast Haste on you, after which it can't cast this spell again until the next dawn. Blackrazor decides when to cast the spell, which takes effect at the start of your turn. The spell lasts for 1 minute (no Concentration required) or until Blackrazor decides to end it, which it can do at the end of any of your turns.\n\nSentience: Blackrazor is a sentient Chaotic Neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 17, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 19. It has hearing and Darkvision out to 120 feet.\n\nThe weapon speaks Common and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice is deep and echoing.

It doesn't care whose souls it eats, including the wielder's. The sword believes that all matter and energy sprang from a void of negative energy and will one day return to it. Blackrazor is meant to hurry that process along.\n\nDespite its nihilism, Blackrazor feels a strange kinship to Wave and Whelm, two other weapons locked away under White Plume Mountain. It wants the three weapons to be reunited and wielded together in combat, even though it violently disagrees with Whelm and finds Wave tedious.\n\nBlackrazor's hunger for souls must be regularly fed. If the sword goes 3 days or more without consuming a soul, a conflict between it and its wielder occurs at the next sunset.\n\nDestroying Blackrazor: Blackrazor can be destroyed by crushing it in the great gears of Mechanus. Primus, the creator of the modrons, also knows a series of musical tones that Blackrazor can't stand to hear, causing the sword to shatter.",

        "description": "The definitive treatise on all that is good in the multiverse, the Book of Exalted Deeds figures prominently in many religions. Rather than being a scripture devoted to a particular faith, the book's authors filled the pages with their own visions of true virtue, providing guidance for defeating evil.\n\nThe Book of Exalted Deeds rarely lingers in one place. As soon as the book is read, it vanishes to some other corner of the multiverse where its moral guidance can bring hope to an endangered world. Although attempts have been made to copy the work, efforts to do so fail to capture its magical nature or translate the benefits it offers to those pure of heart and firm of purpose.\n\nA heavy clasp, wrought to look like angel wings, keeps the book's contents secure. Only a creature that is attuned to the book can release the clasp that holds it shut. Once the book is opened, the attuned creature must spend 80 hours reading and studying the book to digest its contents and gain its benefits.\n\nOther creatures that peruse the book's open pages can read the text but glean no deeper meaning and reap no benefits. A Fiend, an Undead, or a servant of a god from the Lower Planes that tries to read from the book takes 24d6 Radiant damage. This damage ignores Resistance and Immunity, and it can't be reduced or avoided by any means. A creature reduced to 0 Hit Points by this damage disappears in a flash and is destroyed, leaving its possessions behind. The book then vanishes, and the creature's Attunement to it ends.\n\nBenefits granted by the Book of Exalted Deeds last only as long as you strive to do good. If you fail to perform at least one act of kindness or generosity within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform an evil act, you lose all the benefits granted by the book.\n\nCelestial Calm: While attuned to the book, you have Immunity to the Charmed and Frightened conditions and Resistance to Psychic damage. These benefits become permanent after you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book.\n\nDivine Wisdom: After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, your Wisdom increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. You can't gain this benefit from the book more than once.\n\nEnlightened Magic: After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, any spell slot you expend to cast a spell counts as a spell slot of one level higher.\n\nHalo: After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, you gain a protective halo. This halo sheds Bright Light in a 10-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 10 feet. You can dismiss or manifest the halo as a Bonus Action. While present, the halo gives you Advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks. In addition, Fiends and Undead within the halo's Bright Light make attack rolls against you with Disadvantage.\n\nRandom Properties: The Book of Exalted Deeds has the following random properties:\n\n2 Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties properties\n\n2 Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties properties\n\nDestroying the Book: The Book of Exalted Deeds can't be destroyed. However, drowning the book in the River Styx removes all writing and imagery from its pages and renders the book powerless for 1d100 years.",

        "description": "The contents of this foul manuscript are the meat and drink of the wicked. It contains knowledge so horrid that to even glimpse the scrawled pages invites doom.\n\nMost believe the lich-god Vecna authored the Book of Vile Darkness. He recorded in its pages every horrid idea, every corrupt thought, and every example of foul magic he came across or devised.\n\nOther practitioners of evil have added their own input to the book's catalog of vile knowledge. Their additions are clear, for the writers of later works stitched whatever they were writing into the tome or, in some cases, made notations and additions to existing text. There are places where pages are missing, torn, or covered so completely with ink, blood, and scratches that the original text can't be divined.\n\nNature can't abide the book's presence. Ordinary plants wither in its presence, common animals are unwilling to approach it, and the book gradually destroys whatever it touches. Even stone cracks and turns to powder if the book rests on it long enough.\n\nWhenever a creature that isn't a Fiend or an Undead attunes to the Book of Vile Darkness, that creature makes a 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is magically transformed into a Larva under the DM's control. Only a Wish spell can reverse this vile transformation.\n\nA creature attuned to the book must spend 80 hours reading and studying it to digest its contents and use its Adjusted Ability Scores, Tireless Form, Spells, Vile Lore, and Vile Speech properties.\n\nThe Book of Vile Darkness remains with you only as long as you strive to work evil in the world. If you fail to perform at least one evil act within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform a good act, the book disappears, your Attunement to it ends immediately, and you lose all benefits granted by it. If you die while attuned to the book, an entity of great evil claims your soul. You can't be restored to life by any means while your soul remains imprisoned.\n\nAdjusted Ability Scores: One ability score of your choice increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. Another ability score of your choice decreases by 2, to a minimum of 3. The book can't adjust your ability scores again.\n\nTireless Form: While the book is on your person, you have Immunity to the Exhaustion condition.\n\nRandom Properties: The Book of Vile Darkness has the following random properties:\n\n3 Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties properties\n\n1 Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties property\n\n3 Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties properties\n\n2 Artifact Properties; Major Detrimental Properties properties\n\nSpells: While holding the book and holding it, you can cast the following spells (save 18) from it:\n\nAnimate Dead\n\nCircle of Death\n\nDominate Monster\n\nFinger of Death\n\nOnce you use the book to cast a spell, you can't cast that spell again from it until the next dawn.\n\nVile Lore: You can reference the Book of Vile Darkness whenever you make an Intelligence check to recall information about some aspect of evil, such as lore about demons. When you do so, you have Advantage on that check.\n\nAt the DM's discretion, the book might reveal secrets no mortal should know, such as the true names of powerful Fiends, foul rites that allow one to transform into a death knight or lich, or long-lost spells crafted by beings so evil their names ought never to be spoken aloud.\n\nVile Speech: While the book is on your person, you can take a Magic action to recite words from its pages in a foul, dead language. Each time you do so, you take 1d12 Psychic damage, and each creature within 15 feet of you takes 3d6 Psychic damage unless the creature is a Fiend or an Undead.\n\nDestroying the Book: The Book of Vile Darkness allows pages to be torn from it, but any evil lore contained on those pages finds its way back into the book eventually, usually when a new author adds pages to the tome.\n\nIf a solar tears the book in two, the book is destroyed for 1d100 years, after which it re-forms in some far corner of the multiverse.\n\nA creature attuned to the book for 100 years can unearth a phrase hidden in the original text that, when translated to Celestial and spoken aloud, destroys both the speaker and the book in a flash of radiance. However, as long as evil exists in the multiverse, the book re-forms 1d10 × 100 years later.",

        "description": "Ages ago, the serene god Rao created a tool to shield his fledgling faithful against the evils of the Lower Planes. Yet, as eons passed, mortals developed their own methods of dealing with existential threats, and the crook was largely forgotten. In recent ages, though, the Crook of Rao was rediscovered and leveraged against the rising power of the Witch Queen Iggwilv (one of the names of the wizard Tasha). Although she was defeated, Iggwilv managed to damage the crook during the battle, infecting it with an insidious curse-and the potential for future victory. In the aftermath, the crook was again lost. Occasionally it reappears, but the famed artifact is not what it was. Whether or not the artifact's bearers realize its full threat, few risk using the Crook of Rao -potentially for the final time.\n\nRandom Properties: The artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the \"Artifacts\" section of the Dungeon Master's Guide:\n\n2 Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties properties\n\n1 Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties property\n\n1 Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties property\n\nSpells: The crook has 6 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save 18) from it: aura of life (2 charges), aura of purity (2 charges), banishment (1 charge), beacon of hope (1 charge), mass cure wounds (3 charges). The crook regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.\n\nAbsolute Banishment: While you are attuned to the crook and holding it, you can spend 10 minutes to banish all but the mightiest fiends within 1 mile of you. Any fiend with a challenge rating of 19 or higher is unaffected. Each banished fiend is sent back to its home plane and can't return to the plane the Crook of Rao banished it from for 100 years.\n\nFailing Matrix: Whenever the Crook of Rao's Absolute Banishment property is used, or when its last charge is expended, roll on the Extraplanar Reversal table. Any creatures conjured as a result of this effect appear in random unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you and are not under your control.\n\nIggwilv's Curse: When the Crook was last used against Iggwilv, the Witch Queen lashed out at the artifact, infecting its magical matrix. Over the years, this curse has spread within the crook, threatening to violently pervert its ancient magic. If this occurs, the Crook of Rao, as it is currently known, is destroyed, its magical matrix inverting and exploding into a 50-foot-diameter portal. This portal functions as a permanent gate spell cast by Iggwilv. The gate then, once per round on initiative count 20, audibly speaks a fiend's name in Iggwilv's voice, doing so until the gate calls on every fiend ever banished by the Crook of Rao. If the fiend still exists, it is drawn through the gate. This process takes eighteen years to complete, at the end of which the gate becomes a permanent portal to Pazunia, the first layer of the Abyss.\n\nDestroying or Repairing the Crook: The Crook of Rao can either be destroyed or repaired by journeying to Mount Celestia and obtaining a tear from the eternally serene god Rao. One way to make the emotionless god cry would be to reunite Rao with the spirit of his first worshiper who sought revelations beyond the multiverse long ago. The Crook dissolves if immersed in the god's tear for a year and a day. If washed in the tear daily for 30 days, the Crook loses its Failing Matrix property.",

A deck found as treasure is usually missing 1d20 - 1 cards.\n\nThe magic of the deck functions only if cards are drawn at random (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). You can use an action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of you.\n\nAn illusion of one or more creatures forms over the thrown card and remains until dispelled. An illusory creature appears real, of the appropriate size, and behaves as if it were a real creature except that it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and can see it, you can use an action to move it magically anywhere within 30 feet of its card. Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it. Someone who uses an action to visually inspect the creature identifies it as illusory with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The creature then appears translucent.\n\nThe illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled.

        "description": "Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains a number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most (75 percent) of these decks have only thirteen cards, but the rest have twenty-two.\n\nBefore you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.\n\nOnce a card is drawn, it fades from existence. Unless the card is the Fool or the Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice.\n\n| Playing Card       | Card        |\n|--------------------|-------------|\n| Ace of diamonds    | Vizier\\*    |\n| King of diamonds   | Sun         |\n| Queen of diamonds  | Moon        |\n| Jack of diamonds   | Star        |\n| Two of diamonds    | Comet\\*     |\n| Ace of hearts      | The Fates\\* |\n| King of hearts     | Throne      |\n| Queen of hearts    | Key         |\n| Jack of hearts     | Knight      |\n| Two of hearts      | Gem\\*       |\n| Ace of clubs       | Talons\\*    |\n| King of clubs      | The Void    |\n| Queen of clubs     | Flames      |\n| Jack of clubs      | Skull       |\n| Two of clubs       | Idiot\\*     |\n| Ace of spades      | Donjon\\*    |\n| King of spades     | Ruin        |\n| Queen of spades    | Euryale     |\n| Jack of spades     | Rogue       |\n| Two of spades      | Balance\\*   |\n| Joker (with TM)    | Fool\\*      |\n| Joker (without TM) | Jester      |\n\n\\*Found only in a deck with twenty-two cards\n\n**_Balance_**. Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your alignment to change. Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on you.\n\n**_Comet_**. If you single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter, you gain experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no effect.\n\n**_Donjon_**. You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can't be located by any divination magic, but a _wish_ spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.\n\n**_Euryale_**. The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a -2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse.\n\n**_The Fates_**. Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.\n\n**_Flames_**. A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.\n\n**_Fool_**. You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.\n\n**_Gem_**. Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet.\n\n**_Idiot_**. Permanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.\n\n**_Jester_**. You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.\n\n**_Key_**. A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears in your hands. The GM chooses the weapon.\n\n**_Knight_**. You gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character.\n\n**_Moon_**. You are granted the ability to cast the _wish_ spell 1d3 times.\n\n**_Rogue_**. A nonplayer character of the GM's choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a _wish_ spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.\n\n**_Ruin_**. All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.\n\n**_Skull_**. You summon an avatar of death-a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the GM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can't be restored to life.\n\n**_Star_**. Increase one of your ability scores by 2. The score can exceed 20 but can't exceed 24.\n\n**_Sun_**. You gain 50,000 XP, and a wondrous item (which the GM determines randomly) appears in your hands.\n\n**_Talons_**. Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession aren't destroyed but do vanish.\n\n**_Throne_**. You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of monsters, which you must clear out before you can claim the keep as yours.\n\n**_Vizier_**. At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it.\n\n**_The Void_**. This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the GM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. A wish spell can't restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards. \n\n",

        "description": "This treatise, composed by Iggwilv the archmage, documents the Abyss's layers and inhabitants and is widely regarded as the most thorough and blasphemous tome of demonology in the multiverse. The tome recounts both the oldest and most current profanities of the Abyss and demons. Demons have attempted to censor the text, and while sections have been ripped from the book's spine, the general chapters remain, ever revealing demonic secrets. Caged behind lines of script roils a secret piece of the Abyss itself, which keeps the book up-to-date, no matter how many pages are removed, and it longs to be more than mere reference material.\n\nAbyssal Lore: You can reference the Demonomicon whenever you make an Intelligence check to discern information about demons or a Wisdom (Survival) check related to the Abyss. When you do so, you gain Advantage on the check.\n\nContainment: The first ten pages of the Demonomicon are blank. As a Magic action while holding the book, you can target a Fiend that you can see that is trapped within the area of a Magic Circle spell. The Fiend must succeed on a 20 Charisma saving throw with Disadvantage or become trapped within one of the Demonomicon's blank pages, which fills with writing detailing the trapped creature's widely known name and depravities. Once used, this action can't be used again until the next dawn.\n\nWhen you finish a Long Rest, if you and the Demonomicon are on the same plane of existence, one trapped creature within the book can attempt to possess you. You make a 20 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, you are possessed by the creature, which controls you like a puppet. As a Magic action, the possessing creature can release you and appear in the closest unoccupied space to you. On a successful save, the Fiend can't try to possess you again for 7 days (but another Fiend trapped in the book can certainly try).\n\nWhen the tome is discovered, it has 1d4 Fiends occupying its pages—typically an assortment of demons.\n\nEnsnarement: While carrying the book, whenever you cast Magic Circle naming only Fiends or cast Planar Binding targeting a Fiend, the spell is cast at level 9, regardless of what level spell slot you used, if any. Additionally, the Fiend has Disadvantage on its saving throw against the spell.\n\nFiendish Scourging: While carrying the book, when you make a damage roll for a spell you cast against a Fiend, you use the maximum possible result instead of rolling.\n\nRandom Properties: The Artifact has the following random properties:\n\n2 Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties properties\n\n1 Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties property\n\n1 Artifact Properties; Major Detrimental Properties property\n\nSpells: The book has 8 charges and regains 1d8 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the book, you can take a Magic action to cast one of the spells (save 20) on the following table. The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell.\n\nDestroying the Demonomicon: To destroy the book, six different demon lords must each tear out a sixth of the book's pages. If this occurs, the pages reappear after 24 hours. Before all those hours pass, anyone who opens the book's remaining binding is transported to a nascent layer of the Abyss that lies hidden within the book. At the heart of this deadly, semi-sentient domain lies a long-lost Artifact, Fraz-Urb'luu's Staff. If the staff is dragged from the pocket plane, the tome is reduced to a mundane and out-of-date copy of the Tome of Zyx, the work that served as the foundation of the Demonomicon of Iggwilv. The Tome of Zyx can be destroyed like any ordinary book. Once the staff emerges, the demon lord Fraz-Urb'luu knows instantly.",

Each goat looks unique and functions differently from the others. Their properties are as follows:\n\n* The _goat of traveling_ can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a riding horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can't be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all its charges.\n* The _goat of travail_ becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 30 days have passed.\n* The _goat of terror_ becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can't attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a _+1 lance_, and the other becomes a _+2 longsword_. Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. In addition, the goat radiates a 30-foot-radius aura of terror while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat's aura for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can't be used again until 15 days have passed.\n\n**_Marble Elephant (Rare)_**. This marble statuette is about 4 inches high and long. It can become an elephant for up to 24 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.\n\n**_Obsidian Steed (Very Rare)_**. This polished obsidian horse can become a nightmare for up to 24 hours. The nightmare fights only to defend itself. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 5 days have passed.\n\nIf you have a good alignment, the figurine has a 10 percent chance each time you use it to ignore your orders, including a command to revert to figurine form. If you mount the nightmare while it is ignoring your orders, you and the nightmare are instantly transported to a random location on the plane of Hades, where the nightmare reverts to figurine form.\n\n**_Onyx Dog (Rare)_**. This onyx statuette of a dog can become a mastiff for up to 6 hours. The mastiff has an Intelligence of 8 and can speak Common. It also has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet and can see invisible creatures and objects within that range. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.\n\n**_Serpentine Owl (Rare)_**. This serpentine statuette of an owl can become a giant owl for up to 8 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed. The owl can telepathically communicate with you at any range if you and it are on the same plane of existence.\n\n**_Silver Raven (Uncommon)_**. This silver statuette of a raven can become a raven for up to 12 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed. While in raven form, the figurine allows you to cast the _animal messenger_ spell on it at will.",

Many types of _Ioun stone_ exist, each type a distinct combination of shape and color.\n\nWhen you use an action to toss one of these stones into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.\n\nA stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. It is considered to be an object that is being worn while it orbits your head.\n\n**_Absorption (Very Rare)_**. While this pale lavender ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 4th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.\n\nOnce the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can't cancel it.\n\n**_Agility (Very Rare)_**. Your Dexterity score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this deep red sphere orbits your head.\n\n**_Awareness (Rare)_**. You can't be surprised while this dark blue rhomboid orbits your head.\n\n**_Fortitude (Very Rare)_**. Your Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pink rhomboid orbits your head.\n\n**_Greater Absorption (Legendary)_**. While this marbled lavender and green ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 8th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.\n\nOnce the stone has canceled 50 levels of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can't cancel it.\n\n**_Insight (Very Rare)_**. Your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this incandescent blue sphere orbits your head.\n\n**_Intellect (Very Rare)_**. Your Intelligence score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled scarlet and blue sphere orbits your head.\n\n**_Leadership (Very Rare)_**. Your Charisma score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled pink and green sphere orbits your head.\n\n**_Mastery (Legendary)_**. Your proficiency bonus increases by 1 while this pale green prism orbits your head.\n\n**_Protection (Rare)_**. You gain a +1 bonus to AC while this dusty rose prism orbits your head.\n\n**_Regeneration (Legendary)_**. You regain 15 hit points at the end of each hour this pearly white spindle orbits your head, provided that you have at least 1 hit point.\n\n**_Reserve (Rare)_**. This vibrant purple prism stores spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. The stone can store up to 3 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d4 - 1 levels of stored spells chosen by the GM.\n\nAny creature can cast a spell of 1st through 3rd level into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone. If the stone can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.\n\nWhile this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.\n\n**_Strength (Very Rare)_**. Your Strength score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pale blue rhomboid orbits your head.\n\n**_Sustenance (Rare)_**.

        "description": "Not all lingering spirits are tragic souls, lost on their way to the hereafter. Some languish as prisoners, souls so wicked mortals dare not free them upon an unsuspecting afterlife.\n\nCreated by a figure of Vistani legend, Luba's Tarokka of Souls shaped the destiny of countless heroes. The prophecies of this deck of cards also revealed great evils and guided its creator into the path of nefarious forces. Untold times the deck's creator, Mother Luba, narrowly escaped doom, spared only by her keen insights. But even for her, not all wickedness could be escaped. In the most dire cases, Mother Luba managed to ensnare beings of pure evil amid the strands of fate, imprisoning them within her tarokka deck. There these foul spirits dwell still, trapped within a nether-realm hidden amid shuffling cards, waiting for fate to turn foul—as it inevitably will.\n\nLike all Tarokka Deck, the Tarokka of Souls is a lavishly illustrated collection of fifty-four cards, comprising the fourteen cards of the high deck and forty other cards divided into four suits: coins, glyphs, stars, and swords.\n\nRandom Properties: The artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the \"Artifacts\" section of the Dungeon Master's Guide:\n\n2 Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties properties\n\n2 Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties properties\n\nSpells: While holding the deck, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save 18) from it: comprehend languages, detect evil and good, detect magic, detect poison and disease, locate object, or scrying. Once you use the deck to cast a spell, you can't cast that spell again from it until the next dawn.\n\nEnduring Vision: While holding the deck, you automatically succeed on Constitution saving throws made to maintain your concentration on divination spells.\n\nTwist of Fate: As an action, you can draw a card from the deck and twist the fortune of another creature you can see within 15 feet of you. Choose one of the following effects:\n\nThe deck can be used in this way twice, and you regain all expended uses at the next dawn.\n\nPrisoners of Fate: Whenever you use the Twist of Fate property, there is a chance that one of the souls trapped in the deck escapes. Roll d100 and consult the Souls of the Tarokka table. If you roll one of the high cards, the soul associated with it escapes. You can find its statistics in the Monster Manual. If you roll a soul that has already escaped, roll again.\n\nThe released soul appears at a random location within 10d10 miles of you and terrorizes the living. Until the released soul is destroyed, it gains the benefit of a weal from the deck's Twist of Fate property, and both you and the original target of Twist of Fate suffer the effect of woe.\n\nShuffling Fate: If you go 7 days without using the Twist of Fate property, your attunement to Luba's Tarokka of Souls ends, and you can't attune to it again until after another creature uses Twist of Fate on you.\n\nDestroying the Deck: Luba's Tarokka of Souls can be destroyed only if all fourteen souls within are released and destroyed. This reveals a fifteenth soul, a lich, that inhabits the Nether card, which appears only when the fourteen souls are defeated. If this ancient entity is destroyed, the Nether card vanishes and the deck becomes a normal tarokka deck, with no special properties, but it includes a new card of the DM's design.\n\nMother Luba and the Vistani: The creator of the Tarokka of Souls, Mother Luba was one of the most influential leaders of the Vistani. For untold generations, the Vistani have wandered the Shadowfell, which includes terrifying demiplanes like the vampire-haunted realm of Barovia. These travelers have learned many secrets of these domains and encountered countless others wandering amid the Shadowfell's horrors. Most Vistani bands accept well-intentioned wayfarers from diverse walks and of disparate origins, embracing any who seek to find a home amid the endless roads and vistas hidden amid the mists.\n\nA halfling Vistani, Mother Luba led one of the largest groups of Vistani in the Shadowfell. She hailed from the same world that Count Strahd von Zarovich and Madam Eva came from, and she created a community of kindness and resilience-ever rare to find in the Plane of Shadow. She led her people in welcoming strangers, feeding the hungry, and defying the cruel. She and Madam Eva were once friends, until Madam Eva began bargaining with the creatures of the night. \"We may wander amid the shadows,\" Mother Luba said. \"But we must ever serve as a light to our fellow travelers.\"\n\nSome years ago, Mother Luba disappeared into the mists, leaving behind only the Tarokka of Souls. It is said that if you draw the Mists card from it, you can hear the whispers of her kind voice.",

The servant contains enough space for 1 ton of cargo and a crew compartment within, from which up to two Medium creatures can control it-and potentially execute a spree of unstoppable destruction.\n\nTales of the servant's origins involve more conjecture than fact, often referring to otherworldly beings, the mysterious Barrier Peaks in Oerth, and the supposedly related device known as the Machine of Lum the Mad. The best details on the device's origins and operation can be found in the Mind of Metal, a tome of artificer's secrets that connects the device to the traditions of the lost Olman people, and which was written by Lum the Mad's several times over granddaughter, Lum the Maestro, while she reconstructed the long disassembled Mighty Servant of Leuk-o.\n\nDangerous Attunement: Two creatures can be attuned to the servant at a time. If a third creature tries to attune to it, nothing happens.\n\nThe servant's controls are accessed by a hatch in its upper back, which is easily opened while there are no creatures attuned to the artifact.\n\nAttuning to the artifact requires two hours, which can be undertaken as part of a long rest, during which time you must be inside the servant, interacting with its controls. While crew members are attuning themselves, any creature or structure outside and within 50 feet of the servant has a 25 chance of being accidentally targeted by one of its Destructive Fist attacks once during the attunement. This process must be undergone every time a creature attunes itself to the artifact.\n\nControlling the Servant: While any creatures are attuned to the artifact, attuned creatures can open the hatch as easily as any other door. Other creatures can open the hatch as an action with a successful 25 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. A knock spell cast on the hatch also opens it until the start of the caster's next turn.\n\nA creature can enter or exit through the hatch by spending 10 feet of movement. Those inside the servant have Cover from effects originating outside it. The controls within it allow creatures to see outside without obstruction.\n\nWhile you are inside the servant, you can command it by using the controls. During your turn (for either attuned creature), you can command it in the following ways:\n\nOpen or close the hatch (no action required, once per turn)\n\nMove the servant up to its speed (no action required)\n\nAs an action, you can command the servant to take one of the actions in its stat block or some other action.\n\nWhen a creature provokes an opportunity attack from the servant, you can use your reaction to command the servant to make one Destructive Fist attack against that creature.\n\nWhile there are no attuned creatures inside the servant, it is an inert object.\n\nGhost in the Machine: Upon his death, the soul of the mighty warlord Leuk-o was drawn into the artifact and has become its animating force. The servant has been known to attack or move of its own accord, particularly if doing so will cause destruction. Once every 24 hours, the servant, at the DM's discretion, takes one action while uncrewed.\n\nIf the servant loses half of its hit points or more, each creature attuned to it must succeed on a 20 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 24 hours. While charmed in this way, the creature goes on a destructive spree, seeking to destroy structures and attack any unattuned creatures within sight of the servant, starting with those threatening the artifact-preferably using the servant, if possible.\n\nSelf-Destruct: By inputting a specific series of lever pulls and button presses, the servant's two crew members can cause it to explode. The self-destruct code is not revealed to crew members when they attune to the artifact. If the code is discovered (the DM determines how), it requires two attuned crew members to be inside the servant and spend their actions on 3 consecutive rounds performing the command. Should the crew members begin the process of entering the code, though, the servant uses its Ghost in the Machine property and turns the crew members against each other.\n\nIf the crew members successfully implement the code, at the end of the third round, the servant explodes. Every creature in a 100-foot-radius sphere centered on the servant must make a 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 87 (25d6) force damage, 87 (25d6) lightning damage, and 87 (25d6) thunder damage. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. Objects and structures in the area take triple damage. Creatures inside the servant are slain instantly and leave behind no remains.\n\nThis does not destroy the servant permanently. Rather, 2d6 days later, its parts—left arm, left leg, right arm, right leg, lower torso, and upper torso—drop from the sky in random places within 1,000 miles of the explosion. If brought within 5 feet of one another, the pieces reconnect and reform the servant.\n\nDestroying the Servant: The servant can be destroyed in two ways. After it has self-destructed, its disconnected pieces can be melted down in one of the forge-temples of its ancient Olman creators. Alternatively, if the servant strikes the Machine of Lum the Mad, both artifacts explode in an eruption that is three times the size and three times the damage as the servant's self-destruct property.",

The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, 10 hit points, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points.\n\nIf the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of it, you can use an action to speak its command word and activate it. It remains activated until you use an action to speak the command word again.\n\nAny creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror's twelve extradimensional cells. This saving throw is made with advantage if the creature knows the mirror's nature, and constructs succeed on the saving throw automatically.\n\nAn extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror's cells don't age, and they don't need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed.\n\nIf the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it.\n\nWhile within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an action to speak the name of one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror's surface. You and the creature can then communicate normally.\n\nIn a similar way, you can use an action to speak a second command word and free one creature trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.",

        "description": "Of all the magic items created by the elves, one of the most prized and jealously guarded is a moon blade. In ancient times, nearly all elven noble houses claimed one such blade. Over the centuries, some blades have faded from the world, their magic lost as family lines have become extinct. Other blades have vanished with their bearers during great quests. Thus, only a few of these weapons remain.\n\nA moonblade passes down from parent to child. The sword chooses its bearer and remains bonded to that person for life. If the bearer dies, another heir can claim the blade. If no worthy heir exists, the sword lies dormant. It functions like a normal longsword until a worthy soul finds it and lays claim to its power.\n\nA moonblade serves only one master at a time. The attunement process requires a special ritual in the throne room of an elven regent or in a temple dedicated to the elven gods.\n\nA moonblade won't serve anyone it regards as craven, erratic, corrupt, or at odds with preserving and protecting elvenkind. If the blade rejects you, you make ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws with disadvantage for 24 hours. If the blade accepts you, you become attuned to it and a new rune appears on the blade. You remain attuned to the weapon until you die or the weapon is destroyed.\n\nA moonblade has one rune on its blade for each master it has served (typically 1d6 + 1). The first rune always grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Each rune beyond the first grants the moon blade an additional property. The DM chooses each property or determines it randomly on the Moon Blade Properties table.\n\nSentience: A moon blade is a sentient neutral good weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 12. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.\n\nThe weapon communicates by transmitting emotions, sending a tingling sensation through the wielder's hand when it wants to communicate something it has sensed. It can communicate more explicitly, through visions or dreams, when the wielder is either in a trance or asleep.\n\nPersonality: Every moonblade seeks the advancement of elvenkind and elven ideals. Courage, loyalty, beauty, music, and life are all part of this purpose.\n\nThe weapon is bonded to the family line it is meant to serve. Once it has bonded with an owner who shares its ideals, its loyalty is absolute.\n\nIf a moon blade has a flaw, it is overconfidence. Once it has decided on an owner, it believes that only that person should wield it, even if the owner falls short of elven ideals.",

Using the brush and expending 1 pot of pigment, you can paint any number of three-dimensional objects and terrain features (such as walls, doors, trees, flowers, weapons, webs, and pits), provided these elements are all confined to a 20-foot Cube [Area of Effect]. The effort takes 10 minutes (regardless of the number of elements you create), during which time you must remain in the Cube [Area of Effect], and requires Concentration. If your Concentration is broken or you leave the Cube [Area of Effect] before the work is done, all the painted elements vanish, and the pot of pigment is wasted.\n\nWhen the work is done, all the painted objects and terrain features become real. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door, which can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit creates a real pit, the entire depth of which must lie within the 20-foot Cube [Area of Effect].\n\nNo object created by a pot of pigment can have a value greater than 25 GP, and the total value of all objects created by a pot of pigment can't exceed 500 GP. If you paint objects of greater value (such as a large pile of gold), they look authentic, but close inspection reveals they're made from paste, cookies, or some other worthless material.\n\nIf you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm.",

        "description": "Ages past, elves and humans waged a terrible war against evil dragons. When the world seemed doomed, powerful wizards came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five _Orbs of Dragonkind_ (or _Dragon Orbs_) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five wizard towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.\n\nAs the wizard towers fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.\n\nEach orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.\n\nAn orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.\n\nWhile attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb's depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become charmed by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.\n\nWhile you are charmed by the orb, you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts _suggestion_ on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or something else the GM decides.\n\n**_Random Properties_**. An _Orb of Dragonkind_ has the following random properties:\n\n* 2 minor beneficial properties\n* 1 minor detrimental property\n* 1 major detrimental property\n\n**_Spells_**. The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: _cure wounds_ (5th-level version, 3 charges), _daylight_ (1 charge), _death ward_ (2 charges), or _scrying_ (3 charges).\n\nYou can also use an action to cast the _detect magic_ spell from the orb without using any charges.\n\n**_Call Dragons_**. While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can't be used again for 1 hour.\n\n**_Destroying an Orb_**. An _Orb of Dragonkind_ appears fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath weapons of dragons. A _disintegrate_ spell or one good hit from a +3 magic weapon is sufficient to destroy an orb, however.",

You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:\n\nIf you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the conjuration school.\n\nWhen you cast a conjuration spell that summons or creates one creature, you can expend 1 charge to grant that creature advantage on attack rolls for 1 minute.",

It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.\n\nYou can use an action to unfold a _portable hole_ and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the _portable hole_ creates an extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane, so it can't be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open _portable hole_ can exit the hole by climbing out of it.\n\nYou can use an action to close a _portable hole_ by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what's in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.\n\nIf the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole's extradimensional space can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the _portable hole_ or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed _portable hole_ can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.\n\nPlacing a _portable hole_ inside an extradimensional space created by a _bag of holding_, _handy haversack_, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane.

The rod has properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.\n\n**_Six Buttons_**. You can press one of the rod's six buttons as a bonus action. A button's effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form.\n\nIf you press **button 1**, the rod becomes a _flame tongue_, as a fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod's flanged head.\n\nIf you press **button 2**, the rod's flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.\n\nIf you press **button 3**, the rod's flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod's tip, and the rod's handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.\n\nIf you press **button 4**, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form.\n\nIf you press **button 5**, the rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.\n\nIf you press **button 6**, the rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it.\n\n**_Drain Life_**. When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target takes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half that necrotic damage. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.\n\n**_Paralyze_**. When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.\n\n**_Terrify_**. While holding the rod, you can use an action to force each creature you can see within 30 feet of you to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a target is frightened of you for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.",

Regardless of its nature, the paradise contains enough water and food to sustain its visitors. Everything else that can be interacted with inside the extraplanar space can exist only there. For example, a flower picked from a garden in the paradise disappears if it is taken outside the extraplanar space.\n\nFor each hour spent in the paradise, a visitor regains hit points as if it had spent 1 Hit Die. Also, creatures don't age while in the paradise, although time passes normally. Visitors can remain in the paradise for up to 200 days divided by the number of creatures present (round down).\n\nWhen the time runs out or you use an action to end it, all visitors reappear in the location they occupied when you activated the rod, or an unoccupied space nearest that location. The rod can't be used again until ten days have passed.",

Apply your Proficiency and Strength modifier to the attack roll. On a hit, the Shield deals Force damage to the target equal to 2d6 + 2 plus your Strength modifier, and if the target is a creature, you can push it up to 10 feet directly away from yourself. If the creature is your size or smaller, you can also knock it down, giving it the Prone condition.\n\nProtective Field: As a Reaction, when you or an ally you can see within 5 feet of you is targeted by an attack or makes a saving throw against an area of effect, you can use the Shield to create an immobile 5-foot Emanation [Area of Effect] originating from you. When the Emanation [Area of Effect] appears, any creatures or objects not fully contained within it are pushed into the nearest unoccupied spaces outside it. The attack or area of effect that triggered the Reaction has no effect on creatures and objects inside the Emanation [Area of Effect], which lasts as long as you maintain Concentration, up to 1 minute. Nothing can pass into or out of the Emanation [Area of Effect]. A creature or object inside the Emanation [Area of Effect] can't be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the Emanation [Area of Effect] damage anything outside it. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.",

If the sword doesn't taste blood on its blade within 1 minute of being drawn from its scabbard, its wielder makes a 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the wielder takes 3d6 Psychic damage. On a failed save, the wielder is dominated by the sword, as if by the Dominate Monster spell, and the sword demands blood. The spell effect ends when the sword's demand is met.\n\nMagic Weapon: You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with the sword, which scores a Critical Hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20 and deals an extra 2d10 Slashing damage to Undead.\n\nRandom Properties: The sword has the following random properties:\n\n1 Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties property\n\n1 Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties property\n\n1 Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties property\n\n1 Artifact Properties; Major Detrimental Properties property\n\nSpells: While the sword is on your person, you can cast the following spells (save 18) from it:\n\nCall Lightning\n\nDivine Word\n\nFinger of Death\n\nOnce you use the sword to cast a spell, you can't cast that spell again from it until the next dawn.\n\nSpirit of Kas: While the sword is on your person, you gain the following benefits:\n\nBattle Hunger: You add 1d10 to your Initiative rolls.\n\nBlade of Defense: When you take an action to attack with the sword, you can transfer some or all of its attack bonus to your Armor Class instead. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn.\n\nNecrotic Resistance: You have Resistance to Necrotic damage.\n\nSentience: The Sword of Kas is a sentient Chaotic Evil weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 13, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and Darkvision out to 120 feet.\n\nThe weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and speaks Common.\n\nPersonality: The sword's purpose is to bring ruin to Vecna. Killing Vecna's worshipers, destroying the lich's works, and foiling his machinations all help to fulfill this goal.\n\nThe Sword of Kas also seeks to destroy anyone corrupted by the Eye and Hand of Vecna.\n\nDestroying the Sword: A creature attuned to both the Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna can use the Wish property of those combined Artifacts to unmake the Sword of Kas, provided the sword is within 30 feet of the spell's caster. Upon casting Wish, the creature makes a 18 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, nothing happens, and the Wish spell is wasted. On a successful save, the Sword of Kas is destroyed.",

The collection rests within a leather pouch, stitched with images of heroes and whimsical creatures. Where the teeth fall, they bring legends to life.\n\nUsing the Teeth: While you are holding the pouch, you can use an action to draw one tooth. Roll on the Teeth of Dahlver-Nar table to determine which tooth you draw, and you can either sow the tooth or implant it (both of which are described later).\n\nIf you don't sow or implant the tooth, roll a die at the end of your turn. On an even number, the tooth vanishes, and creatures appear as if you sowed the tooth, but they are hostile to you and your allies. On an odd number, the tooth replaces one of your teeth as if you implanted it (potentially replacing another implanted tooth, see below).\n\nEach tooth can only be used once. Track which teeth have been used. If a tooth's result is rolled after it's been used, you draw the next lowest unused tooth on the table.\n\nSowing Teeth: To sow the tooth, you place it on the ground in an unoccupied space within your reach, or you throw it into an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you in a body of water that is at least 50 feet wide and 50 feet long. Upon doing so, the tooth burrows into the ground and vanishes, leaving no hole behind, or it vanishes into the water. The creatures noted in the Creatures Summoned column appear in an unoccupied space as close to where the tooth was sown as possible. The creatures are allies to you, speak all languages you speak, and linger for 10 minutes before disappearing, unless otherwise noted.\n\nImplanting Teeth: To implant the tooth, you place it in your mouth, whereupon one of your own teeth falls out, and the drawn tooth takes its place, resizing to fit in your mouth. Once the tooth is implanted, you gain the effect noted in the Implanted Effect column. The tooth can't be removed while you are attuned to the teeth, and you can't voluntarily end your attunement to them. If removed after your death, the tooth vanishes. You can have a maximum number of the teeth implanted at one time equal to 1 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 2 teeth total). If you try to implant more teeth, the newly implanted tooth replaces one of the previous teeth, determined randomly. The replaced tooth vanishes, and you lose the implanted effect.\n\nRecovering Teeth: Once all the teeth have vanished, their pouch also vanishes. The pouch with all the teeth then appears in a random destination, which could be on a different world of the Material Plane.\n\nDestroying the Teeth: Each tooth must be destroyed individually by sowing it in the area where the tooth's story originated, with the intention to destroy it. When planted in this way, creatures summoned are not friendly to you and do not vanish. Some of the creatures summoned merely head off in search of home, while others act as their tales dictate. In either case, the tooth is gone forever.",

Structures in contact with the ground in that area take 50 Bludgeoning damage, and each creature on the ground in that area must succeed on a 20 Dexterity saving throw or have the Prone condition. If that creature is also Concentration, it must succeed on a 20 Constitution saving throw or its Concentration is broken. In addition, you can cause a 30-foot-deep, 10-foot-wide fissure to open up on the ground anywhere in the area. Any creature on a spot where the fissure opens must make a 20 Dexterity saving throw, falling into the fissure on a failed save or moving with the fissure's edge on a successful one. Any structure on a spot where the fissure opens collapses into the fissure. Once you use this property, it can't be used again until the next dawn.",

When it does, it magically appears wherever the demon lord senses an opportunity to achieve some fell goal.\n\nThe wand is topped with a skull that once belonged to a human hero slain by Orcus. The wand can magically change in size to better conform to the grip of its user. All Holy Water within 10 feet of the wand is destroyed.\n\nAny creature besides Orcus that tries to attune to the wand makes a 17 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature takes 10d6 Necrotic damage. On a failed save, the creature dies and, if it is a Humanoid, turns into a Zombie.\n\nMagic Weapon: You can wield the wand as a magic Mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it. The wand deals an extra 2d12 Necrotic damage on a hit.\n\nRandom Properties: The Wand of Orcus has the following random properties:\n\n2 Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties properties\n\n1 Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties property\n\n2 Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties properties\n\n1 Artifact Properties; Major Detrimental Properties property\n\nThe detrimental properties of the Wand of Orcus are suppressed while the wand is attuned to Orcus.\n\nProtection: You gain a +3 bonus to Armor Class while holding the wand.\n\nSpells: The wand has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the wand, you can cast one of the spells on the following table from it (save 18). The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell.\n\nWhile attuned to the wand, Orcus or a follower blessed by him can cast each of the wand's spells using 2 fewer charges (minimum of 0).\n\nCall Undead: While holding the wand, you can take a Magic action to conjure 15 Skeleton and 15 Zombie. These Undead magically rise up from the ground or otherwise form in unoccupied spaces within 300 feet of you and obey your commands until they are destroyed or until the next dawn, when they collapse into inanimate piles of bones and rotting corpses. Once you use this property, you can't use it again until the next dawn.\n\nWhile holding the wand, Orcus can summon any kind of Undead, not just skeletons and zombies. These Undead don't perish at dawn the following day, remaining until Orcus dismisses them.\n\nSentience: The Wand of Orcus is a sentient Chaotic Evil item with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and Darkvision out to 120 feet.\n\nThe wand communicates telepathically with its wielder and speaks Abyssal and Common.\n\nPersonality: The wand's purpose is to help satisfy Orcus's desire to slay everything in the multiverse. The wand is cruel, nihilistic, and bereft of humor.\n\nTo further Orcus's goals, the wand feigns devotion to its current user and makes grandiose promises that it has no intention of fulfilling, such as vowing to help its user overthrow Orcus.\n\nDestroying the Wand: Destroying the Wand of Orcus requires that it be taken to the Positive Energy Plane by the ancient hero whose skull surmounts it. For this to happen, the long-lost hero must first be restored to life—no easy task, given the fact that Orcus has imprisoned the hero's soul and keeps it hidden and well guarded.\n\nBathing the wand in positive energy (such as that which permeates the Positive Plane) causes it to crack and explode, but unless the above conditions are met, the wand instantly re-forms on Orcus's layer of the Abyss.",

        "description": "Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp). With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods. One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer's work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn. One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk. In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces. A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.",

        "description": "Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp). With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods. One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer's work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn. One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk. In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces. A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.",

        "description": "Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp). With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods. One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer's work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn. One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk. In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces. A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.",
